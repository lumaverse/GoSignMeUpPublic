A break &#x60;end_at&#x60; must not be after the &#x60;Shift.end_at&#x60;

            Updates an open [Order](#type-order) by adding, replacing, or deleting fields. Orders with a &#x60;COMPLETED&#x60; or &#x60;CANCELED&#x60; state cannot be updated.  An UpdateOrder request requires the following:  - The &#x60;order_id&#x60; in the endpoint path, identifying the order to update. - The latest &#x60;version&#x60; of the order to update. - The [sparse order](/orders-api/manage-orders#sparse-order-objects) containing only the fields to update and the version the update is being applied to. - If deleting fields, the [dot notation paths](/orders-api/manage-orders#on-dot-notation) identifying fields to clear.  To pay for an order, please refer to the [Pay for Orders](/orders-api/pay-for-orders) guide.  To learn more about the Orders API, see the [Orders API Overview](/orders-api/what-it-does).

These roles define the actions and permissions granted to an employee with that role.

Roles are assigned with the [V1UpdateEmployee](#endpoint-v1updateemployee) endpoint. An employee can have only one role at a time.  If an employee has no role, they have none of the permissions associated with roles. All employees can accept payments with Square Point of Sale.

Offline payments have a &#x60;created_at&#x60; value that reflects the time the payment was originally processed, not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

            RetrieveSettlement Provides comprehensive information for a single settlement.  The returned &#x60;Settlement&#x60; objects include an &#x60;entries&#x60; field that lists the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual adjustments, or chargeback holds.  Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807) help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.  Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may take longer.

            Filter for &#x60;Order&#x60; objects based on whether their &#x60;CREATED_AT&#x60;, &#x60;CLOSED_AT&#x60; or &#x60;UPDATED_AT&#x60; timestamps fall within a specified time range. You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter for only one time range at a time.  For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.  __Important:__ If you use the DateTimeFilter in a SearchOrders query, you must also set the &#x60;sort_field&#x60; in [OrdersSort](#type-searchorderordersort) to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the &#x60;CLOSED_AT&#x60; field in DateTimeFilter, you must also set the &#x60;sort_field&#x60; in SearchOrdersSort to &#x60;CLOSED_AT&#x60;. Otherwise, SearchOrders will throw an error. [Learn more about filtering orders by time range](/orders-api/manage-orders#important-note-on-filtering-orders-by-time-range).

            <summary>
            A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.  Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The &#x60;tender&#x60; field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.  Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:  The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.  *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the associated payment.  When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A &#x60;Tender&#x60; object with a type of &#x60;SQUARE_GIFT_CARD&#x60; indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the associated payment.
